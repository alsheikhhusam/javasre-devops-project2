# WEATHER WIDGET

## Project Description

Weather Widget is a small lightweight version of a weather API that allows the user to get current or 7-day forecast weather data based on city name or zip code number. This project focuses on the DevOps side of things where the microservices where deployed to a Kubernetes Cluster that where monitored by a Grafana dashboard and Prometheus. The stages where automated by a CI/CD Jenkins Pipeline.
